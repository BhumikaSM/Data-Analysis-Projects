## üìä eCommerce Data Analysis & Dashboard Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and dashboard creation using an eCommerce dataset. The main objective is to extract actionable insights about customer behavior, sales performance, return trends, and product performance using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle:
Ecommerce Data on Kaggle

It contains over 500,000 records of transactions from an online UK-based retailer, including:

- InvoiceNo
- StockCode
- Description
- Quantity
- InvoiceDate
- UnitPrice
- CustomerID
- Country

## üßÆ Data Cleaning (Excel)
Issues Addressed:
Handled missing values: particularly missing InvoiceDate and CustomerID.

- Removed duplicate rows and null records.

- Converted data types for InvoiceDate, Quantity, and UnitPrice.

- Removed transactions with negative or zero values (except returns).
  
- Calculated Total Price (Total Price = Quantity √ó UnitPrice)


## üìä Data Analysis

A significant number of returns were observed, especially in certain countries.

The top-selling products could be targeted for promotions.

RFM segmentation helps in identifying loyal vs. at-risk customers.
