## üìä eCommerce Data Analysis & Dashboard Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and dashboard creation using an eCommerce dataset. The main objective is to extract actionable insights about customer behavior, sales performance, return trends, and product performance using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle:
Ecommerce Data on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data
(This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers)
It contains over 500,000 records of transactions from an online UK-based retailer, including:

- InvoiceNo
- StockCode
- Description
- Quantity
- InvoiceDate
- UnitPrice
- CustomerID
- Country

## üßÆ Data Cleaning (Excel)
Issues Addressed:
Handled missing values: particularly missing InvoiceDate and CustomerID.

- Removed duplicate rows and null records.

- Converted data types for InvoiceDate, Quantity, and UnitPrice.

- Removed transactions with negative or zero values (except returns).
  
- Calculated Total Price (Total Price = Quantity √ó UnitPrice)

 ## Python
  - Setting up environment using python libraries
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - top selling products
  - Revenue over time (visualizing using matplotlib)
  - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis using Python
  - Return Analysis (Using Matplotlib)
  - 

## üìà Power BI Dashboard
Pages and Visuals Created:
1. Dashboard Overview (Page Title Displayed)
   Contains a dynamic page title using a text box for branding and clarity.
   
2.KPI cards
  - Total orders (count of distinct InvoiceNo)
  - Total Items Sold (Sum of Quantity)
  - Unique Customers (Distinct Count Of CustmerID)
  - Total Revenue (Sum Of Total Revenue)
  visual: New Cards

3. Customer Type Distribution
   Displays counts of Unique vs. Returning customers.

‚úÖ Customers from the UK accounted for the majority of transactions.

‚úÖ 91.02% of customers are registerd and 8.98% of customers are unregisterd(guest customers)
